# IoT Lab Programs

1. Learn the basics of Arduino MCU boards, features and pinouts of Arduino UNO, differentiate between READ and WRITE pins, install and configure the Arduino IDE, and basics of soldering.

2. Arduino program to blink an LED and implement a traffic signal system using digitalWrite() and pinMode() functions.

3. Arduino program to vary the intensity of LED based on the reading of Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) using analogRead() and analogWrite() functions.

4. Arduino program to toggle LED by pressing a button and to implement a switch debounce circuit to prevent glitches in user input.

5. Arduino program to implement a serial communication event.

6. Arduino program to implement a temperature and humidity sensor and switch ON an LED if the temperature is too hot.

7. Arduino program to drive a DC motor and a stepper motor.

8. Arduino program to implement an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance to an obstacle and “buzz” when too close to object.

9. Arduino program to implement a 16x2 LCD alphanumeric display and display temperature and current date and time.

10. Arduino program to implement a GSM module and send SMS using some carrier to a cellphone number.
